Homework1-Week 1:

  Create a function (similar to the read_csv_from_s3) which reads json files from

S3, for the taxi and weather data. The goal is to replace these three rows:

    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=taxi_trip_key)
    content = response["Body"]
    taxi_trips_data_json = json.loads(content.read())

  With a function call:

    taxi_trips_data_json = read_json_from_s3(PARAMETERS)

Upload the Transform Load Lambda function to your github (just copy into the
whole code into a notebook), and send me your github.
